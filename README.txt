# Parallel-Computing-CPUvsGPU_Vector_Addition
This project explores vector addition and computing a 1-D stencil of an average.
It compare CPU compute time with a parallelized version written using CUDA to leverage GPUs.
The results are presented in the pdf in the folder for those that are interested.
